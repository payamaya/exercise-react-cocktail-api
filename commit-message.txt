Enhance UI with CSS Animations and Pagination Improvements -m Added CSS animations to animate cards when they enter the view on scroll. This improves the visual appeal and user experience of the card components. -m Implemented ellipses in the pagination component to handle large numbers of pages more gracefully. Note: some minor issues with the ellipses need to be fixed later. This commit is for demo purposes only to test the changes and see how they work.
